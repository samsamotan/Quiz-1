# Enrico Miguel Uy 🤓

Hello, my name is **Enrico Miguel N. Uy** and  I am 19 years old. I am an only child in my family, no siblings, no more. I currently study at the Asian Institute of Management for the BSDSBA program. To be honest I have never been a computer kid in my entire life, so learning about computers became a new interest for me. I can't wait to share, tell, explore, and learn together new things in this subject, *Data Mining and Wrangling*

To get to know more about me, here are **three things that describe about myself**.

## Athlete 🎾

Tennis is my sport and it's been with me for almost my whole life. I started around when I was 8 years old and got proper hard training at the age of 14 years old. I have been joining official tournaments in the country, making me reach Quarter-Finals twice during my junior years. Tennis for me is not just a passion, it is one of the things that keeps me well trained, disciplined, and motivated in my every day life.

## Musician 🎸

As a musician, I started playing guitar at the age of around 10 or 11 years old. I started not jut do covers but also written my own songs at the age of 15 years old. I have written about 8 to 9 songs already from my younger days. I would love to do a duet or be in a band someday and not just being a solo artist.

## Adventure ✈️

At first I wanted to become a pilot as my future profession because of my grandfather who used to be the pilot for us going to South Korea every year since I was a baby. I love to travel and explore new countries that I have never been to in my entire life. Hopefully by becoming also a businessman, athlete and musician can help me achieve it.
